# ES Module Shims

[Release Notes](CHANGELOG.md)

[93% of users](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module) are now running browsers with baseline support for ES modules.

But modules features like Import Maps will take a while to be supported in browsers.

_It turns out that we can actually polyfill new modules features on top of these baseline implementations in a performant 9.5KB shim._

This includes support for:

* [Import Maps](https://github.com/wicg/import-maps) support.
* Dynamic `import()` shimming when necessary in eg older Firefox versions.
* `import.meta` and `import.meta.url`.
* JSON and CSS modules with import assertions.
* `<link rel="modulepreload">` polyfill in non Chromium browsers for both shimmed and unshimmed preloading scenarios.

In addition a custom [fetch hook](#fetch-hook) can be implemented allowing for streaming in-browser transform workflows to support custom module types.

Because we are still using the native module loader the edge cases work out comprehensively, including:

* Live bindings in ES modules
* Dynamic import expressions (`import('src/' + varname')`)
* Circular references, with the execption that live bindings are disabled for the first unexecuted circular parent.

Due to the use of a tiny [Web Assembly JS tokenizer for ES module syntax only](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer), with very simple rewriting rules, transformation is very fast, although in complex cases of hundreds of modules it can be a few hundred milliseconds slower than using SystemJS or native ES modules. See the [SystemJS performance comparison](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs#performance) for a full performance breakdown in a complex loading scenario.

## Usage

Include ES Module Shims with a `async` attribute on the script:

For example, from CDN:

```html
<!-- UNPKG -->
<script async src="https://unpkg.com/es-module-shims@0.14.0/dist/es-module-shims.js"></script>

<!-- JSPM.IO -->
<script async src="https://ga.jspm.io/npm:es-module-shims@0.14.0/dist/es-module-shims.js"></script>
```

Then there are two ways to use ES Module Shims: Polyfill Mode and [Shim Mode](#shim-mode).

### Polyfill Mode

Just write your HTML modules like you would in the latest Chrome:

```html
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "app": "./src/app.js"
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module">import 'app'</script>
```

and ES Module Shims will make it work in [all browsers with any ES Module Support](#browser-support).

> `<script type="importmap">` should always be placed before any `<script type="module">` as per native support in browsers.

You will typically see a console error in browsers without import maps support like:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "app". Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".
  at <anonymous>:1:15
```

This execution failure is a feature - it avoids the polyfill causing double execution. The first import being a bare specifier in the pattern above is important to ensure this.

This is because the polyfill cannot disable the native loader - instead it can only execute modules that would otherwise fail instantiation while avoiding duplicate fetches or executions.

If using CSS modules or JSON modules, since these features are relatively new, they require manually enabling using the initialization option:

```html
<script>window.esmsInitOptions = { enable: ['css-modules', 'json-modules'] }</script>
```

See the [Polyfill Mode Details](#polyfill-mode-details) section for more information about how the polyfill works and what options are available.

### Shim Mode

Shim mode is an alternative to polyfill mode and doesn't rely on native modules erroring - instead it is triggered by the existence of any `<script type="importmap-shim">` or `<script type="module-shim">`, or when explicitly setting the [`shimMode` init option](#shim-mode-option).

In shim mode, normal module scripts and import maps are entirely ignored and only the above shim tags will be parsed and executed by ES Module Shims instead.

Shim mode also provides some additional features that aren't yet natively supported such as [external import maps](#external-import-maps) with a `"src"` attribute or [dynamicallly injecting import maps](#dynamic-import-maps), which can be useful in certain applications.

### Import Maps

> Stability: WhatWG Standard, Single Browser Implementer

Import maps allow for importing "bare specifiers" in JavaScript modules, which prior to import maps throw in all browsers with native modules support.

Using this polyfill we can write:

```html
<script type="importmap-shim">
{
  "imports": {
    "test": "/test.js"
  },
  "scopes": {
    "/": {
      "test-dep": "/test-dep.js"
    }
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module-shim">
  import test from "test";
  console.log(test);
</script>
```

All modules are still loaded with the native browser module loader, but with their specifiers rewritten then executed as Blob URLs, so there is a relatively minimal overhead to using a polyfill approach like this.

#### Multiple Import Maps

Multiple import maps are not currently supported in any native implementation, Chromium support is currently being tracked in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=927119.

In polyfill mode, multiple import maps are therefore not supported.

In shim mode, support for multiple `importmap-shim` scripts follows the [import map extensions](https://github.com/guybedford/import-maps-extensions) proposal.

#### External Import Maps

External import maps (using a `"src"` attribute) are not currently supported in any native implementation.

In polyfill mode, external import maps are therefore not supported.

In shim mode, external import maps are fully supported.

#### Dynamic Import Maps

Support for dynamically injecting import maps with JavaScript via eg:

```js
document.body.appendChild(Object.assign(document.createElement('script'), {
  type: 'importmap',
  innerHTML: JSON.stringify({ imports: { x: './y.js' } }),
}));
```

is supported in Chromium, provided it is injected before any module loads and there is no other import map yet loaded (multiple import maps are not supported).

Both modes in ES Module Shims support dynamic injection using DOM Mutation Observers.

While in polyfill mode the same restrictions apply that multiple import maps, import maps with a `src` attribute, and import maps loaded after the first module load are not supported, in shim mode all of these behaviours are fully enabled for `"importmap-shim"`.

### Dynamic Import

> Stability: Stable browser standard

Dynamic `import(...)` within any modules loaded will be rewritten as `importShim(...)` automatically
providing full support for all es-module-shims features through dynamic import.

To load code dynamically (say from the browser console), `importShim` can be called similarly:

```js
importShim('/path/to/module.js').then(x => console.log(x));
```

### import.meta.url

> Stability: Stable browser standard

`import.meta.url` provides the full URL of the current module within the context of the module execution.

### modulepreload

> Stability: WhatWG Standard, Single Browser Implementer

Preloading of modules can be achieved by including a `<link rel="modulepreload" href="/module.js" />` tag in the HTML or injecting it dynamically.

This tag also supports the `"integrity"`, `"crossorigin"` and `"referrerpolicy"` attributes as supported on module scripts.

This tag just initiates a fetch request in the browser and thus works equally as a preload polyfill in both shimmed and unshimmed modes, with integrity validation support.

Unlike the browser specification, the modulepreload polyfill does not request dependency modules by default, in order to avoid unnecessary
code analysis in the polyfill scenarios. **It is recommended to preload deep imports anyway so that this feature shouldn't be necessary.**

### JSON Modules

> Stability: WhatWG Standard, Single Browser Implementer

In shim mode, JSON modules are always supported. In polyfill mode, JSON modules require the `polyfillEnable: ['json-modules']` [init option](#polyfill-enable-option).

JSON Modules are currently supported in Chrome when using them via an import assertion:

```html
<script type="module">
import json from 'https://site.com/data.json' assert { type: 'json' };
</script>
```

In addition JSON modules need to be served with a valid JSON content type.

Checks for assertion failures are not currently included.

### CSS Modules

> Stability: WhatWG Standard, Single Browser Implementer

In shim mode, CSS modules are always supported. In polyfill mode, CSS modules require the `polyfillEnable: ['css-modules']` [init option](#polyfill-enable-option).

CSS Modules are currently supported in Chrome when using them via an import assertion:

```html
<script type="module">
import sheet from 'https://site.com/sheet.css' assert { type: 'css' };
</script>
```

To support the polyfill or shim of this feature, the [Constructable Stylesheets polyfill](https://github.com/calebdwilliams/construct-style-sheets#readme) must be separately included in browsers not supporting [Constructable Stylesheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet/CSSStyleSheet) eg via:

```html
<script async src="https://unpkg.com/construct-style-sheets-polyfill@3.0.0/dist/adoptedStyleSheets.js"></script>
```

For more information see the [web.dev article](https://web.dev/css-module-scripts/).

In addition CSS modules need to be served with a valid CSS content type.

Checks for assertion failures are not currently included.

### Resolve

> Stability: No current browser standard

`import.meta.resolve` provides a contextual resolver within modules. It is asynchronous, like the Node.js implementation, to support waiting on any in-flight
import map loads when import maps are [loaded dynamically](#dynamic-import-map-updates).

The second argument to `import.meta.resolve` permits a custom parent URL scope for the resolution, which defaults to `import.meta.url`.

```js
// resolve a relative path to a module
var resolvedUrl = await import.meta.resolve('./relative.js');
// resolve a dependency from a module
var resolvedUrl = await import.meta.resolve('dep');
// resolve a path
var resolvedUrlPath = await import.meta.resolve('dep/');
// resolve with a custom parent scope
var resolvedUrl = await import.meta.resolve('dep', 'https://site.com/another/scope');
```

This implementation is as provided experimentally in Node.js - https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_no_require_resolve.

## Polyfill Mode Details

In polyfill mode, feature detections are performed for ES modules features. In browsers with full feature support no further processing is done.

In browsers with variable feature support, sources are analyzed using the very fast Wasm-based lexer while sharing the source network fetch cache with the native loader, and only those sources known by the analysis to require syntax features not natively supported in the browser will then be reexecuted.

#### Polyfill Features

The current default native baseline for the ES module shims polyfill mode is browsers supporting import maps.

If using more modern features like CSS Modules or JSON Modules, these need to be manually enabled via the [`polyfillEnable` init option](#polyfill-enable-option) to raise the native baseline to only browsers supporting these features.

#### Polyfill Edge Cases

The guarantee of the polyfill is that any module graph that would have failed will be reexecuted through the shim layer. This leaves any edge case where execution succeeds but not as expected. For example when using dynamic imports:

```html
<script type="module">
  console.log('Executing');
  const dynamic = 'bare-specifier';
  import(dynamic).then(x => {
    console.log('Ok');
  }, err => {
    console.log('Fail');
  });
</script>
```

The native browser loader without import maps support will execute the above module fine, but fail on the lazy dynamic import.

ES Module Shims will not reexecute the above in browsers without import maps support though because it will see that the execution did complete successfully therefore it will not attempt reexecution and as a result, `"Ok"` is never logged.

Other examples include dynamically injecting import maps, or using import maps with a `"src"` attribute, which aren't supported in native Chrome.

This is why it is advisable to always ensure modules use syntax that will fail early to avoid non-execution.

#### Skip Polyfill

Adding the `"noshim"` attribute to the script tag will also ensure that ES Module Shims skips processing this script entirely:

```html
<script type="module" noshim>
  // ...
</script>
```

#### Load Events

Native module scripts only fire `'load'` events but not `'error'` events per the specification.

In polyfill mode, DOM `'load'` events are always retriggered, such that the second load event can be reliably considered the polyfill completion, fired for both success and failure completions like the native loader (except in Safari which uniquely fires the module script error event), and always twice (once from the native loader, secondly by the polyfill), whether or not the polyfill actually resulted in execution.

This behaviour can be disabled via the [`noLoadEventRetriggers` option](#no-load-event-retriggers).

To dynamically load a module and get a callback once its execution has been triggered or failed, the following code snippet can therefore be used:

```js
function loadModuleScript (src) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    let first = true;
    function callback () {
      if (first) first = false;
      else resolve();
    }
    document.head.appendChild(Object.assign(document.createElement('script'), {
      type: 'module',
      src,
      onload: callback,

      // Safari Fix:
      // Safari is the only browser that triggers "error" events instead of "load" events
      // for both error and success like Firefox and Chrome
      onerror: callback
    }));
  });
}
```

Where native module script errors are propagated via `window.onerror`, [`esmsInitOptions.onerror`](#error-hook) can be used to catch polyfill errors.

## CSP Build

ES Module Shims uses a Web Assembly lexer to execute blob URLs. Web Assembly currently always requires the `unsafe-eval` CSP policy to be set which can weaken the security requirements of an application.

For better CSP compatibility an alternative build that uses a JS-based lexer is provided, which offers [comporable performance](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer#js-build) although with a slower cold start due to leaning more heavily on the JS compiler to kick in for the lexer as opposed to the AOT compilation benefits of using Wasm.

This build is exported as `es-module-shims/csp` located at the `dist/es-module-shims.csp.js` file path.

CSP compatibility is enabled by adding the `'nonce-...'` CSP nonce rule.

The nonce will then be read from the preceding module scripts in the page, or alternatively via the [`nonce` init option](#nonce).

A full example of such a CSP workflow is provided below:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'nonce-n0nce'" />
<script async src="es-module-shims.csp.js"></script>
<script type="importmap" nonce="n0nce">
{
  "pkg": "/pkg.js"
}
</script>
<script type="module" nonce="n0nce">
import pkg from 'pkg';
</script>
```

## Init Options

Provide a `esmsInitOptions` on the global scope before `es-module-shims` is loaded to configure various aspects of the module loading process:
o
```html
<script>
window.esmsInitOptions = {
  shimMode: true, // default false
  polyfillEnable: ['css-modules', 'json-modules'], // default empty
  nonce: 'n0nce', // default null
  noLoadEventRetriggers: true, // default false
  skip: /^https:\/\/cdn\.com/, // defaults to `/^https?:\/\/(cdn\.skypack\.dev|jspm\.dev)\//`
  onerror: (e) => { /*...*/ }, // default noop
  resolve: (id, parentUrl, resolve) => resolve(id, parentUrl), // default is spec resolution
  fetch: (url) => fetch(url), // default is native
  revokeBlobURLs: true, // default false
}
</script>
<script async src="es-module-shims.js"></script>
```

If only setting JSON-compatible options, the `<script type="esms-options">` can be used instead:

```html
<script type="esms-options">
{
  "shimMode": true,
  "polyfillEnable": ["css-modules", "json-modules"],
  "nonce": "n0nce"
}
</script>
```

This can be convenient when using the [CSP build](#csp-build).

See below for a detailed description of each of these options.

### Shim Mode Option

[Shim Mode](#shim-mode) can be overridden using the `shimMode` option:

```html
<script type="esms-options">
{
  "shimMode": true
}
</script>
```

For example, if lazy loading `<script type="module-shim">` scripts alongside static native module scripts, shim mode would not be enabled at initialization time.

DOM `load` events are fired for all `"module-shim"` scripts both for success and failure just like for native module scripts.

### Pollyfill Enable Option

The `polyfillEnable` option allows enabling polyfill features which are newer and would otherwise result in unnecessary polyfilling in modern browsers that haven't yet updated.

Currently this option supports just `"css-modules"` and `"json-modules"`.

```html
<script type="esms-options">
{
  "polyfillEnable": ["css-modules", "json-modules"]
}
</script>
```

### Nonce

The `nonce` option allows setting a CSP nonce to be used with all script injections for full CSP compatibility supported by the [CSP build](#csp-build) of ES Module Shims.

Alternatively, add a `blob:` URL policy with the CSP build to get CSP compatibility.

```js
<script type="esms-options">
{
  "nonce": "n0nce"
}
</script>
```

### No Load Event Retriggers

Because of the extra processing done by ES Module Shims it is possible for static module scripts to execute after the `DOMContentLoaded` or `readystatechange` events they expect, which can cause missed attachment.

In order to ensure libraries that rely on these event still behave correctly, ES Module Shims will always double trigger these events that would normally have executed before the document ready state transition to completion.

In such a case, this double event firing can be disabled with the `noLoadEventRetriggers` option:

```js
<script type="esms-options">
{
  // do not re-trigger DOM events (onreadystatechange, DOMContentLoaded and load events on scripts)
  "noLoadEventRetriggers": true
}
</script>
<script async src="es-module-shims.js"></script>
```

### Skip Processing

When loading modules that you know will only use baseline modules features, it is possible to set a rule to explicitly opt-out modules from rewriting. This improves performance because those modules then do not need to be processed or transformed at all, so that only local application code is handled and not library code.

This can be configured by providing a URL regular expression for the `skip` option:

```js
<script type="esms-options">
{
  skip: "/^https:\/\/cdn\.com/" // defaults to `/^https?:\/\/(cdn\.skypack\.dev|jspm\.dev)\//`
}
</script>
<script async src="es-module-shims.js"></script>
```

By default, this expression supports `jspm.dev`, `dev.jspm.io` and `cdn.pika.dev`.

#### Error hook

You can provide a function to handle errors during the module loading process by providing an `onerror` option:

```js
<script>
  window.esmsInitOptions = {
    onerror: error => console.log(error) // defaults to `((e) => { throw e; })`
  }
</script>
<script async src="es-module-shims.js"></script>
```

#### Resolve Hook

The resolve hook is supported for shim mode only and allows full customization of the resolver, while still having access to the original resolve function.

```js
<script>
  window.esmsInitOptions = {
    shimMode: true,
    resolve: async function (id, parentUrl, defaultResolve) {
      if (id === 'custom' && parentUrl.startsWith('https://custom.com/'))
        return 'https://custom.com/custom.js';

      // Default resolve will handle the typical URL and import map resolution
      return defaultResolve(id, parentUrl);
    }
  }
</script>
```

### Fetch Hook

The fetch hook is supported for shim mode only.

The ES Module Shims fetch hook can be used to implement transform plugins.

For example:

```js
<script>
  window.esmsInitOptions = {
    shimMode: true,
    fetch: async function (url) {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      if (response.url.endsWith('.ts')) {
        const source = await response.body();
        const transformed = tsCompile(source);
        return new Response(new Blob([transformed], { type: 'application/javascript' }));
      }
      return response;
    } // defaults to `(url => fetch(url))`
  }
</script>
<script async src="es-module-shims.js"></script>
```

Because the dependency analysis applies by ES Module Shims takes care of ensuring all dependencies run through the same fetch hook,
the above is all that is needed to implement custom plugins.

Streaming support is also provided, for example here is a hook with streaming support for JSON:

```js
window.esmsInitOptions = {
  shimMode: true,
  fetch: async function (url) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok)
      throw new Error(`${response.status} ${response.statusText} ${response.url}`);
    const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type');
    if (!/^application\/json($|;)/.test(contentType))
      return response;
    const reader = response.body.getReader();
    return new Response(new ReadableStream({
      async start (controller) {
        let done, value;
        controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array([...'export default '].map(c => c.charCodeAt(0))));
        while (({ done, value } = await reader.read()) && !done) {
          controller.enqueue(value);
        }
        controller.close();
      }
    }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/javascript"
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### Revoke Blob URLs

When polyfilling the missing features `es-module-shims` would create in-memory blobs using `URL.createObjectURL()` for each processed module.
In most cases, memory footprint of these blobs is negligible so there is no need to call `URL.revokeObjectURL()`
for them, and we don't do that by default.

That said, in some scenarios, e.g. when evaluating some continuously changing modules without a page reload, like in a web-based code editor,
you might want to reduce the growth of memory usage by revoking those blob URLs after they were already `import`ed.

You can do that by enabling the `revokeBlobURLs` init option:

```js
<script type="esms-options">
{
  "revokeBlobURLs": true
}
</script>
<script type="module" src="es-module-shims.js"></script>
```

NOTE: revoking object URLs is not entirely free, while we are trying to be smart about it and make sure it doesn't
cause janks, we recommend enabling this option only if you have done the measurements and identified that you really need it.

## Implementation Details

### Import Rewriting

* Sources are fetched, import specifiers are rewritten to reference exact URLs, and then executed as BlobURLs through the whole module graph.
* The [lexer](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer) handles the full language grammar including nested template strings, comments, regexes and division operator ambiguity based on backtracking.
* When executing a circular reference A -> B -> A, a shell module technique is used to "shim" the circular reference into an acyclic graph. As a result, live bindings for the circular parent A are not supported, and instead the bindings are captured immediately after the execution of A.

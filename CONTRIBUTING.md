## Tests
The tests are written using mocha and located in the `test` folder.
The entrypoint for each test is the corresponding html page.

To run the test suites start a local http server of your choice, e.g. `npx http-server -c-1`
and open one of the test html pages in your browser, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/test/test.html`.
